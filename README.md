- CrossMap  
  * CrossMap is a program for convenient conversion of genome coordinates (or annotation files) between different assemblies (such as Human hg18 (NCBI36) <> hg19 (GRCh37), Mouse mm9 (MGSCv37) <> mm10 (GRCm38)).  
  * It supports most commonly used file formats including SAM/BAM, Wiggle/BigWig, BED, GFF/GTF, VCF.  
  * CrossMap is designed to liftover genome coordinates between assemblies. Itâ€™s not a program for aligning sequences to reference genome.
