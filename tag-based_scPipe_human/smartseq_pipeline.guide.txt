Please using the following directories structure to store data and files (Important!)
And run the smartseq_pipeline main.sh files in the smartseq_pipeline directory (Important!)

workspace dir
|-- data_raw
|   |-- E5-K_R1.fastq.gz
|   |-- E5-K_R2.fastq.gz
|   |-- E5-L_R1.fastq.gz
|   |-- E5-L_R2.fastq.gz
|   |-- E5-M_R1.fastq.gz
|   |-- E5-M_R2.fastq.gz
|   |-- E5-X_R1.fastq.gz
|   `-- E5-X_R2.fastq.gz
`-- sample.txt

Usage:
1. file "sample" includes sample names corresponding to file names under data_raw, such as the following
E5-K
E5-L
E5-M
E5-X
2. using "nohup sh $pipelineDir/main.sh $workspace_dir $sample_path $skipcode $process_n $barcode_path > pipeline.log 2>&1 &" to run.
3. There will be two directories named "out_smartseq" and "out_results" to be created in the workspace dir!
